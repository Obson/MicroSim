    // which in effect stands for nationalised industries.
    //
    // IMPORTANT
    // At present the only firm in existence is the government-owned firm
    // (gov). If we keep on spending money into this firm it will keep
    // expanding. This will provide us with a means of expanding the economy,
    // but as we don't want it to be a single-industry economy we won't spend
    // any more on it after the zeroth period. This will change eventually.
