    // At present this is unconditional, but we need to allow for either
    // automatic (rule-based) or manual changes throughout a run as
    // government expenditure needs to be exogenous.

    // government funds, to avoid disrupting the standard payment
    // mechanism. This also ensures that no tax will be paid by recipients
