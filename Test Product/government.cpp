// TO DO NEXT
// ----------
// This method creates and registers a new independent firm with, at present,
// no visible means of support. To fix this we will need to provide a means
// of accessing government funds. Conventionally this is achieved via banks,
// so what we probably need to do is implement the Bank class and set the
// new firm up with a 'line of credit'. I think this means that the firm can
// keep borrowing more money as long as it keeps up the repayments on the
// existing loan and pays the interest due. I suspect this is inherently
// unstable and is only sustainable as long as the firm continues to grow.
// Eventually the market becomes saturated and the firm dies -- or possibly
// it just sucks in business from other less successful firms in the same
// field, and they die.

    // IMPORTANT
    // At present this is unconditional, but we need to allow for either
    // automatic (rule-based) or manual changes throughout a run as
    // government expenditure needs to be exogenous.
    //   Note also that we use a special 'grant' method to transfer
    // government funds, to avoid disrupting the standard payment
    // mechanism. This also ensures that no tax will be paid by recipients
