     Important!
     ----------
     Do we need to keep a separate list of accounts so they can be triggered
     independently of their owners? This would cause some complications as
     we need to ensure that they are triggered in the order: Government, 
     Firms, Workers, Pool.available, so maybe Government and Pool are the
     only ones that need to be triggered externally and the others could be
     cascaded.
