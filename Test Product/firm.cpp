// The 'government-owned' firm is the only firm that is created initially and
// serves as a target for government spending. Other firms come into existence
// depending on economic conditions.
//
// Suppose a firm (or all firms taken together) produce goods and services to the
// value of n cus (currency units). If all their stock is sold (the best case
// scenario) they will receive payments of n cus. This is the most they can pay
// their employees without drawing on credit and is therefore the most they can
// pay out in wages (without drawing on credit). However, their employees will
// have to return some of this money to the government in taxes and will not
// therefore be able to buy all the stock. This means there will be less money
// available to pay out in wages next time, and even less stock will be produced.
// Eventually the company will have to get rid of its employees and go out of
// business.
//
// The only way this can be avoided is by the injection of new money. Mechanisms
// are: constantly increasing credit from the bank, payment of benefits to the
// unemployed (so that in effect the unemployed will be subsidising the employed)
// and direct purchases from the firms by the government (using new money).
