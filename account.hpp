    // ---------
    // We consider a year to be made up of 50 periods and a
    // typical yearly wage to be 25000 -- i.e. 500 per period.
    // Initially we will assume everyone is paid the same
    // amount, but we will need to allow different schemes,
    // such as random with even distribution, random with
    // normal distribution, and random with lognormal
    // distribution. The latter seems to give a fairly
    // convincing 'long-tail' distribution.
    //
    // A distribution based on recorded peercentile
    // figures for the UK in 2015 approximates to the
    // polynomial:
    //
    // 0.00001229(x^6) + 0.0033(x^5) + 0.3373(x^4) + 16.066(x^3) + 359
    //
    // where 0 < x < 100 is the percentile. It should be possible
    // to work out a distribution function that would produce
    // this result. The table itself can be found at
    //
    // https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax
    //
    // and it might be more straightforward to base wages on
    // that. An alternative approach would be to start off with
    // equal (or evenly distributed) wages and see what
    // develops over time.
