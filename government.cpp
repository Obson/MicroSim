// TO DO NEXT
// ----------
// This method creates and registers a new independent firm with, at present,
// no visible means of support. To fix this we will need to provide a means
// of accessing government funds. Conventionally this is achieved via banks,
// so what we probably need to do is implement the Bank class and set the
// new firm up with a 'line of credit'. I think this means that the firm can
// keep borrowing more money as long as it keeps up the repayments on the
// existing loan and pays the interest due. I suspect this is inherently
// unstable and is only sustainable as long as the firm continues to grow.
// Eventually the market becomes saturated and the firm dies -- or possibly
// it just sucks in business from other less successful firms in the same
// field, and they die.
